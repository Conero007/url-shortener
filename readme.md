# URL Shortener in Golang

This project is a straightforward URL shortener application written in Go. It leverages MySQL for robust persistent storage and Redis for efficient caching. The application features a dual-API systemâ€”one for the creation of customized short URLs and another for ensuring seamless redirection to the original URLs. 

## Prerequisites

To run this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go 1.21 or later
- MySQL 8.0 or later
- Redis 7 or later

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Conero007/url-shortener.git
   ```

2. Run the bash script present in the `/bash` folder. This script sets up a Docker network on your system and creates a `.env` file with the contents of the `.example.env` file:

   ```bash
   sh bash/setup.sh
   ```

3. Configure your `.env` file with the credentials for your environment, prefilled with values for the configuration present in the github repo:

   ```env
   # App Config
   APP_URL=127.0.0.1
   PORT=3000

   # Database creds
   DB_ADDR=db:3306
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=1234
   DB_NAME=url_shortener

   # Redis creds
   REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=
   ```

4. Configure your `.testing.env` file with the credentials for your testing environment, prefilled with values for the configuration present in the github repo:

   ```env
   # App Config
   APP_URL=127.0.0.1
   PORT=3000

   # Database creds
   DB_ADDR=db:3306
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=1234
   DB_NAME=url_shortener_testing

   # Redis creds
   REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=
   ```

5. Run the following commands to build and start the application. This will also run the unit tests present in the project. If the tests fail, the application will not start:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

6. If all containers are up and running, the project is successfully up on your system, and its API endpoint can be accessed at the following URL:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1/<endpoint>
   ```

## Usage

The application provides the following API endpoints:

1. `/shorten`: This endpoint is used to create a new short URL. Optionally, you can also provide a custom short key for generating a custom short URL. The request body should contain the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://www.example.com",
     "custom_short_key": "abc123"
   }
   ```

   - A successful response will contain the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "original_url": "https://www.example.com",
     "short_url": "http://localhost:3000/abc123",
     "expire_time": "2024-02-10"
   }
   ```

   - A failed response will contain the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "error": "<error message>"
   }
   ```

2. `/{key}`: This endpoint is used to redirect to the original URL. The `key` parameter is the short key of the URL.

   - On a successful response, you will be redirected to the original URL.

   - A failed response will contain the following JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "error": "<error message>"
   }
   ```

## Code Overview

The application is structured as follows:

- `app/`: This directory contains the main application code, including controller and handler logic.
- `database/`: This directory contains the code for handling the migrations for the database.
- `models/`: This directory contains the data models and their logic for the application.
